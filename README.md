# SHOW ME THE WAY TO GO HOME
A model to show how drunks wonder randomly, or stagger around at night to reach their homes. Agent based modelling approach is used to initiate the drunks, their houses and the field or environment they walk in. The 25 drunks start from one location(pub) and wonder in the environment until they make it to their home.
